# Moonriver 🌙

A terminal-based console for connecting to and interacting with **Klipper**
instances via the **Moonraker** WebSocket API.

**Moonriver** provides a fast, efficient, and color-coded way to monitor and
control your 3D printer, all from the comfort of your command line. Built
entirely in **Rust** for speed and reliability.

---

## ✨ Features

**Moonriver** aims to bring the core functionality of a Klipper interface
directly to your terminal, similar in spirit to a command-line Read-Eval-Print
Loop (REPL).

### 🚀 **Connectivity & Performance**

- **Moonraker WebSocket Integration:** Connects directly to a remote Moonraker
  instance using its WebSocket API, providing **real-time data** without
  polling.
- **Built with Rust:** Leverages Rust's memory safety and performance
  characteristics for a **fast, low-latency** experience.
- **Simple Configuration:** Easily configure the Moonraker host address and API
  key via a simple configuration file or command-line arguments.
- Automatic reconnection if Klipper restarts or is unavailable
- Scripting support
- Multiple G-Code commands per line -- use `,` as a separator
- Tab autocompletion for user-defined macros
- Support for multiple printers via
  [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)

### 💻 **Terminal Experience**

- **Rich Terminal Coloring:** Utilizes terminal color schemes to categorize and
  highlight different types of information (e.g., green for G-code responses,
  yellow for warnings, red for errors), ensuring **easy readability** at a
  glance.
- **Interactive Command Line:** Provides a familiar, interactive command-line
  interface for sending commands.
- **Command History:** Access and reuse previous commands using the up and down
  arrow keys.
- Syntax highlighting for both G-Code and user-defined macros

### 🖨️ **Klipper & Printer Control**

- **G-code Submission:** Directly submit G-code commands to your Klipper
  instance and view the immediate responses.
- **Configuration File Access:** Easily retrieve and potentially modify Klipper
  configuration files (`printer.cfg`, etc.) directly through the console.
- **Printer Status Monitoring:** Display key status information, such as:
  - **Tool/Bed Temperatures:** Real-time temperature readings and target values.
  - **Extruder Position/State:** Current position and state information.
  - **Homing/Mainsail Status:** Quick access to the printer's operational state.
- **Macro Execution:** Send and execute defined Klipper macros instantly.
- M112 emergency stop processing

## 🛠️ Usage

### Running interactively

To get started, simply run the `moonriver` executable:

```bash
moonriver --host <moonraker-url> --port <port>
```

Once connected, you can type your G-code commands:

```
> G28
// Printer response: X axis homed
// Printer response: Y axis homed
// Printer response: Z axis homed
> M105
// Printer response: T:20.5 /0.0 B:21.1 /0.0
> GET_TEMP SENSOR=heater_bed
// Printer response: // Current temperature of heater_bed is 21.1
```

### Usage in scripts

You can evaluate one line of G-Code as follows. Note that you can use the `,`
character to incorporate multiple G-Code commands into one line, and that G-Code
is case-insensitive (but generally gets converted to uppercase by Klipper).

```sh
moonriver --host <moonraker-url> --port <port> g28, screws_tilt_calculate
```

### Emergency stop

Typing the command `m112` into `moonriver` will immediately discard the rest of
the command buffer and send an emergency stop signal to Klipper.
