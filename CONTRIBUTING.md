   cd moonriver
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- A Moonraker/Klipper instance for testing (optional but recommended)

### Building

```bash
cargo build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Running Locally

```bash
cargo run -- --host localhost --port 7125
```

## Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Ensure your code compiles without warnings:
   ```bash
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   ```
3. Format your code:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   ```
4. Test your changes thoroughly

## Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Start commit messages with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Reference issues when applicable (e.g., "Fixes #123")

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md if you're adding features or fixing bugs
3. Push your changes to your fork
4. Create a Pull Request from your fork to the main repository
5. Ensure all CI checks pass
6. Wait for review from maintainers

## Code Style

- Follow standard Rust conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Write documentation for public APIs
- Add tests for new functionality
